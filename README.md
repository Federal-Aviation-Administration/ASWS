# Airport Status Web Service (ASWS)

ASWS provides current airport status of major United States airports. Information provided by the service includes delays,
ground stops, and weather information from the National Weather Service. In this sense, it is a composite web service that pulls data from fly.faa.gov and www.weather.gov to provide timely information about major US airports.
